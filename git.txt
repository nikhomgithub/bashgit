//Work with git hub
//====================================================
.. work with many people
we are working with team on master at our PC and 
after finish first master 
we push onto github respo master 

echo "# bashgit" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git push https://github.com/nikhomgithub/bashgit.git master


//for new user who want to work in this project, at first need to clone project 
//to clone respo mean we want to copy project from respo into our empty folder 
git clone https://github.com/nikhomgithub/bashgit.git // we git remote orgin from git hub

//but new user better crete a branch first and edit project file

git branch mybranch
git checkout mybranch 
//edit file in project
git add .
git commit -m "second version"
git remote -v mean to check remote origin 
https://github.com/nikhomgithub/bashgit.git (fetch) 
https://github.com/nikhomgithub/bashgit.git (push) 

git push origin mybranch mean push back to respo as a branch
got to github to create pull request to boos
boss check and merge pull request to master at github!!!!!!

everythink will become master 

someone else might clone/pull respo to their pc and edit master/create branch
and push back to respo with master/branch 

we want to change something in file we pull back to merge with our master in PC

git pull origin master mean to merge respo into our pc

then we create branch 
git checkout -b fileB

edit file again

git add .
git commit -m "fileB"     
git push origin fileB mean will push to github respo as branch "fileB"

so at github we have to send  "compare and pull request" merge branch into master at github 

our boss will check conflict and "merge pull request" our branch to master.

conclue
Mr.A (assignee) do master and push 
Someone (assignee) might clone master and change master/branch 
Mr.A pull master from github to his PC to create a branch
Mr.A push branch to github and send "compare and pull request" to boss (reviewer)
(remember not to merge that branch in Mr.A's PC , boss must check and merge at github)
Boss check and "merge pull request" on github
new at github Master is updated
